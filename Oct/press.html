								<h3>CNET | Amanda Kooser </h3>
								<p>There are plenty of waterproof Bluetooth speaker options for people who want to groove to their tunes while scrubbing up. There's even a shower curtain with speakers and a built-in tablet holder. But none of these gadgets can compete against the oddity that is the Octaloofah on Kickstarter, a device that combines a massager, loofah and Bluetooth speaker into one weird package.

The device suctions onto your shower wall and sports four round loofah pads, a massage nodule and a waterproof speaker. The pads can be removed and replaced.

The idea is that you sidle up the Octaloofah and use it to scrub those hard-to-reach places on your back or work out a knot in your shoulder. The whole while, you can be singing along to songs like "Blame it on the Rain" by Milli Vanilli. You can also take phone calls through the speaker, but that's generally a bad idea for obvious reasons.</p>

								<p>Octaloofah feels like the sort of product that would appear in the pages of SkyMall. It's a head-scratcher of a back-scratcher, but it has a certain goofy appeal to it. If you're planning to buy a Bluetooth shower speaker anyway, then you might consider the Octaloofah since it comes with the bonus scrubbers. It would probably feel pretty good to run a hot shower, exfoliate the middle of your back and sing along with "It's Raining Men" at the top of your lungs all at the same time.</p>

								<h4>UBER APPARATUS</h4>
								<p>Exfoliate and massage your back, hands-free and listen to your favorite tunes! How? Well with a new shower product called the Octaloofah, soon to be the number one reason to hog the shower for as long as possible. The Octaloofah is a hands-free back scrubbing device with a twist of fun, excitement, pleasure, jubilation and exfoliation all wrapped into one. The inventor of the Octaloofah believes that the shower process has grown stale, nowadays it’s all about rushing in and out, the Octallofah will help you relax in the shower again. That’s right, relax, listen to some music on the built-in bluetooth speaker and even take calls from your girl. You gotta love that! So back this project and get ready to de-stress yourself or even gift it to a friend, just donate $49.00 or more and  Octaloofah is yours.</p>
